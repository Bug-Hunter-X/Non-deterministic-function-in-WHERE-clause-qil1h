This repository contains an example of a SQL query with a non-deterministic function in the WHERE clause. The query uses the RAND() function to generate random numbers. This function is non-deterministic, so the results of the query can vary from one execution to the next, even if the data in the table does not change.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult. The solution shows how to rewrite the query using a deterministic function.
