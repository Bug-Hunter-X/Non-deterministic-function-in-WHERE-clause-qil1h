The solution is to rewrite the query using a deterministic function or to move the non-deterministic function to the SELECT clause.  Here's how the query could be rewritten:

```sql
-- Original query with non-deterministic function in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE RAND() < 0.5;

-- Solution: Moving the non-deterministic function to the SELECT clause
SELECT *, RAND() AS random_number FROM employees HAVING random_number < 0.5;

--Alternative Solution (if applicable): use a deterministic approach to filtering.
--Example: Selecting employees with IDs less than 100
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id < 100; 
```

The solution moves the non-deterministic function `RAND()` from the `WHERE` clause to the `SELECT` clause (and uses `HAVING` to filter), ensuring that the filter condition is evaluated after the random numbers are generated for each row, thereby avoiding the unpredictable filtering behavior of the original query.  Another approach, shown in the alternative solution, is to avoid the non-deterministic function altogether and instead use a deterministic condition to filter your data.
